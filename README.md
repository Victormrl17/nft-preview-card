## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project, I reinforced my knowledge of CSS Flexbox for layout design and CSS variables to manage colors and themes. I also practiced responsive design principles to ensure the component looks good on both mobile and desktop screens.

Here's an example of a CSS variable for colors:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
:root {
  --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}
```

```js
.card-details {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to further explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and experiment with animations for hover states. Also, working more with responsive typography is something I'd like to improve.
